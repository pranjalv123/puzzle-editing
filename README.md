# puzzletron

Software for editing/testing puzzles for the [MIT Mystery Hunt](http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/)

Currently being hacked by Random Fish in preparation for the 2015 Hunt.

## To initialize mysql database:

* Log into your mysql database server with full administrative priviliges.
* Create a puzzletron user
 
        CREATE USER '<mysqlusername>' IDENTIFIED BY '<mypassword>';

* Create a puzzletron database
 
        CREATE DATABASE <databasename>;

* Grant the puzzletron user access to that database

        GRANT ALL ON <databasename>.* TO '<mysqlusername>'

* Then execute

        mysql -u <mysqlusername> -s <servername> -p <databasename> < schema.sql

  (enter password for the puzzletron DB user when prompted)

## Setup configuration:

* Copy `config.php.EXAMPLE` to `config.php` and edit appropriately.
* Make sure HTML Purifier is installed and referenced appropriately in `config.php`
* `DB_NAME` is the name of the database you created above
* `URL` is the URL what links referring back to this puzzletron instance should be
* `TRUST_REMOTE_USER` disables the internal puzzletron user database and trusts the apache `REMOTE_USER` variable (only do this if you have apache auth set up and a separate authentication database) (warning: Random Fish doesn't have this turned on and doesn't know if our changes have broken Puzzletron if it does get turned on)
* `DEVMODE` --- is the server in Development/Test mode?
* `PRACMODE` --- is the server in Practice / pre-hunt-writing mode?
* Copy `secret.php.EXAMPLE` to `secret.php` and edit appropriately

## Customize database stuff:

* `priv` table contains list of roles and what privileges they have
* `pstatus` table contains list of possible puzzle statuses and what can happen at each status

## To get email notifications working:

In order for puzzletron to actually send its email queue (comments on puzzles, etc.)
there needs to be a cron job that runs `email_cronjob.php` script with your php interpreter
at some regular frequency.

## File Permissions:

Make sure the uploads directory (and everything underneath it) is writable and searchable by your web server
